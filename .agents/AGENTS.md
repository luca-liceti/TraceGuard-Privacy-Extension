# Project Rules

- Always recompile the project when finished editing.
- When dealing with colors, always ensure they respect the light and dark theme toggle.
- When adding or replacing a UI section, it must be grabbed from an existing popular shadcn template.
- **Actionable Data over Vanity Metrics:** Always prioritize actionable and highly useful information over vanity metrics when designing data visualizations, charts, or dashboards. Ensure every data point provides genuine value or understanding of privacy risks.
- Never use em dashes in writing: comments, documentation, commit messages, and chat. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or separate sentences instead. This does not apply to product UI strings: translations and dashboard copy may keep em dashes.
- Be specific and precise in all writing. Name exact files, functions, and values. Avoid vague or filler phrasing.

## Behaviour change

- The purpose of every feature is a positive change in the user's browsing habits, with as much friction as that takes and no more. Removing friction entirely is not the goal: a tool that never costs the user anything never changes what they do.
- **Spend friction only where it changes a decision, and nowhere else.** A warning at the moment of the risky action is worth more than any number on a dashboard.
- Classify every user-facing element as exactly one of four things, and label it as such when adding **or reviewing** it:
  - **Persuasion** tries to change a decision. It must name the behaviour, in one sentence, and appear where the decision is made. Name the behaviour, not the metric: "hand a card to fewer sites", not "increase engagement".
  - **Context** is true information with no claim on behaviour. It does not have to change anything, but it must not pretend to persuade.
  - **Entitlement** is transparency, control, correctness, or safety: export, delete, the vault lock, permission transparency, detector-failure notices. It is owed to the user regardless of effect and is never justified by behaviour change.
  - **Decoration** is none of the above. Cut it.
- The classification applies to what is already shipped, not only to proposals. Most of what fails the test is already on screen.
- Put the information where the decision is made. If it can only appear on a dashboard the user has to open, call it informing rather than changing, and say so in the pull request or the roadmap entry.
- The default must be safe. Doing nothing must not be a mistake, and no behaviour change may depend on configuration or setup.
- Every claim must be true. An overstated warning teaches users to dismiss the tool, which kills the real warning later. Never credit TraceGuard with an effect it does not have.
- Reward actions the user takes, not outcomes they stumble across. Rewarding a "safe site visit" teaches avoidance of risk signals instead of risk, and the user controls the input, so it is farmable.
- Never suppress a discouraging truth to protect motivation. If the honest picture demotivates, the user is still owed it.
- Steering must be visible and reversible. An assistant that quietly optimises the user's behaviour is a dark pattern aimed at a good end.
- When proposing or reviewing a feature, state its classification and act on it: strengthen a persuasion, label a context, leave an entitlement alone, cut a decoration. A persuasion that cannot name a behaviour does not go on the roadmap. See `adr/0010-behaviour-change-as-the-goal.md` and `adr/0011-behaviour-test-boundary.md`.

## Commits

- Commit every change. Do not leave work uncommitted across turns: once a change is done and its typecheck, tests, and build pass, commit it before starting the next thing. You have standing permission to commit without asking each time; commit as the last step of the change, not as a separate request.
- One logical change per commit. Never bundle unrelated edits, and never sweep pre-existing dirty files into a commit for work you did not do.
- Use the repository's conventional style (`fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`) and name the user-facing effect.
- Every commit and push is authored and committed as `Luca <lucaliceti+github@protonmail.com>`, with no exception and no other address. Pass it per command (`GIT_AUTHOR_NAME` / `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL` / `GIT_COMMITTER_NAME` / `GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL`, or `git commit --author`), and never edit the git config to change it.
- Never credit an AI tool or assistant in this repository, in any commit message, code, comment, doc, changelog, or PR text. Every form of it is forbidden: a `Generated with ...` trailer, a `Co-Authored-By` line naming an assistant, a robot emoji used as a credit marker, and the name of the tool anywhere in a commit message. There are no exceptions, and none of it is optional because a tool produced the text: the credit is not wanted, and it is not an accurate description of work that a person reviewed and owns. This is a standing rule for every agent working in this repository, applied to every commit, without being asked.
- Include the version bump and the `CHANGELOG.md` entry in the same commit as the change they describe.
- Pushing stays explicit: commit locally every change, but run `git push` only when the user asks or when releasing (see Releasing). Never force-push and never rewrite history.

## Diagnostics and failure reporting

- Every failure path reports through `src/lib/diagnostics.ts`. Never ship a silent failure: no empty `catch {}`, no `.catch(() => {})`, and no `catch` that only writes to a console nobody has attached.
- Do not use `console.*` for anything worth knowing later. Signatures, cache decisions, and calculation steps belong in `logEvent`, not in a tree of `console.log` lines that dies with the devtools console. Deprecation notices are the only exception.
- Classify each `catch` when you write it. A genuine bug or broken invariant uses `captureError(area, error, eventName)`, which also lands in the durable error log. A transient or expected condition (worker asleep, network offline, invalid URL, optional data absent) uses `logEvent(area, 'warn', eventName, message)`, which stays in the session log.
- Pass only what is needed to reproduce the failure: host names, detector names, scores, error strings, and field types. Never log full URLs or anything the user typed.
- Keep the global `error` and `unhandledrejection` handlers installed in every context: the background service worker, the content script, the popup, the side panel, and the dashboard. Call `setDiagnosticContext(area)` beside the installation so an uncaught error names the context that raised it. Removing either is a regression.
- Browser noise is not an error. Chrome fires layout warnings such as `ResizeObserver loop completed with undelivered notifications.` as window `error` events. Record them at `debug` as `benign_browser_noise`, never through `captureError`, so the durable 100-entry error log keeps only real failures. Add a pattern to `BENIGN_ERROR_PATTERNS` in `src/lib/diagnostics.ts` when another known-benign warning appears in a bundle.
- Developer mode (`devMode` in settings) is off by default. Verbose events persist only to `chrome.storage.session`, are wiped when the browser closes, and are never written to disk or synced. The About tab in `settings-modal.tsx` owns the toggle and the "Copy diagnostics" button.
- A detector that fails must never read as a clean result. When a detector returns a fallback score because it threw, record the failure so a broken detector is distinguishable from a safe site, and surface its status in the UI when you touch that path.
- Developer mode must make every number explicable. When you add or change a detector, a score, a database, or a service lookup, record its inputs and its fallback, not just the output: `detector_ran` per detector with raw counts and duration, `page_analysis_complete` with the `explainWSS` weights and contributions, `database_loaded` with entry counts, `reputation_checked` with the deciding layer and `blacklistSize`.
- A degraded component must be visible even when it produces a plausible number. An unloaded blocklist (`blacklistSize: 0`) means every site reads as clean, an empty bundled database silently detects nothing, and a neutral fallback score hides a detector that never returned. Record each through `captureError` or an explicit field (`database_empty`, `database_load_failed`, `blacklist_load_failed`, `invalid_score_fallback`).
- Keep the scoring math in `explainWSS` in `src/lib/scoring.ts`. Never reimplement the weights elsewhere; `calculateWSS` wraps it so the score and its audit trail cannot disagree.
- Every context that logs syncs developer mode itself. Each entry point calls `syncDevModeFromSettings()` on load, the content script re-syncs where it reads settings for an analysis, and the worker also re-syncs from `chrome.storage.onChanged`. A context that only reads the flag at startup drops its own verbose events until Chrome restarts it, which looks identical to "nothing is happening".
- `chrome.storage.session` stays restricted to trusted contexts: it holds the vault key (`cryptoKeyHex`) and the locked-vault buffer key (`bufferKeyHex`), so widening it with `chrome.storage.session.setAccessLevel` would expose the master key to every page a content script runs on. A content script instead batches its developer-mode events and relays them to the worker with `{ type: 'DIAGNOSTIC_EVENTS' }`; the worker is the only writer and appends them through `appendRelayedEvents` in `src/lib/diagnostics.ts`.
- When the event buffer drops older events, `formatDiagnosticsReport` states that it did and how many. A timeline with a hidden gap must never read as "nothing happened".

## Communication

- Explain work in plain language, pitched at an entry-level developer. Lead with what the change does for the user, then how it works.
- Define a term the first time it appears ("the worker, the part that runs with no window"). Avoid unexplained internal shorthand.
- Keep the precise details. Simple is not vague: name the file, the function, and the exact behaviour, then describe it in words a new developer can follow.
- When something is only partly done, say which parts are done and which are not, rather than describing it as finished.

## Keeping these rules current

- This file is the living source of project conventions. When a change establishes a new workflow, convention, or standard, add or update the rule here in the same commit as the code, so every future agent or developer inherits it.
- Rewrite or delete rules that no longer match the code. A stale rule is worse than no rule.
- Rules name exact files, functions, commands, and settings keys.

## Versioning

- Follow SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). See VERSIONING.md for the full policy.
- package.json is the single source of truth for the version. Never edit the version anywhere else (manifest.json syncs automatically via the prebuild hook).
- Every change that ships counts as a new version. Bump the version in package.json for any extension change: PATCH for fixes, MINOR for features or additions, MAJOR for breaking changes or large redesigns.
- Include the version bump in the same commit as the change it describes.

## Releasing

- Every release must include a `CHANGELOG.md` entry at the top of the file (newest first) with a **What's new** and/or **What was fixed** section describing the user-facing changes. Write it before tagging: the Release workflow copies that top section into the GitHub release body, so a tag without an entry ships an empty release.
- Release by tagging: bump the version with `npm version patch|minor|major`, then `git push && git push --tags`.
- **The bundled feeds refresh themselves at release, so no one has to remember to.** The Release workflow runs `npm run build:phishlist`, `npm run sign:phishlist`, and `npm run build:tosdr` before it builds the ZIP, so a release always ships current data. The scheduled `refresh-threat-feed` and `refresh-tosdr` workflows commit the same refresh to `main` between releases. Do not add a manual release step that repeats this: a rule describing work the pipeline already does is a rule that rots.
- **A local data refresh is a deliberate act, not a build side effect.** `npm run build` builds only, and never rewrites `src/assets/phishlist.json` or `src/assets/tosdr-data.json`. Run `npm run data:refresh` when you want the bundled data as current as CI's, and commit the result on its own as `chore: refresh the bundled phishing blocklist`, never inside a feature commit. `scripts/build-phishlist.js` keeps the last snapshot when a feed is unreachable, so a refresh never fails for want of a network.
- The Release workflow builds `traceguard-extension-v<tag>.zip`, creates a GitHub release, and, if store credentials are configured (secrets `CHROME_WEB_STORE_CLIENT_ID`, `CHROME_WEB_STORE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `CHROME_WEB_STORE_REFRESH_TOKEN` and variable `EXTENSION_ID`), auto-uploads the ZIP to the Chrome Web Store.
- Store uploads are upload-only (submitted for review); publishing happens manually in the Chrome Web Store dashboard.
- If store credentials are not configured, the upload step is skipped and the ZIP is uploaded to the store manually by downloading it from the GitHub release.
