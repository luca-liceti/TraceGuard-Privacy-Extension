# Changelog

Each release ships with **What's new** and/or **What was fixed** describing user-facing changes. The release workflow pulls the top section of this file into the GitHub release body.

## v1.4.3

**What's new**

- First click of the extension icon on a fresh install now opens the dashboard's vault-creation page (in both popup and side-panel mode) instead of squeezing account setup into the popup.
- The dashboard sidebar automatically collapses to icons when the window gets too small and expands again when it returns to a normal size.
- Personal-data penalties on risky sites are now gated behind the "Is this website safe?" confirmation card — confirming vouchsafes the site and waives the penalty for that visit.
- The dashboard now recovers automatically after an extension update instead of showing a crash screen when a stale page chunk can no longer be loaded.

**What was fixed**

- Score graph: the 7-day and 30-day tabs now plot each day's closing score (the real trajectory) instead of an average, with a larger history so those tabs show actual data; the donut's up/down delta now matches the chart, and a proper loading state replaced the "No data yet" flash.
- Fixed false-positive personal-data detection: German "ein" fields no longer count as SSNs, and "unit" quantity fields no longer count as addresses.
- Fixed score corruption when a user's score is 0 — penalties and recoveries no longer compute from a baseline of 100.
- Cookie and tracker detection no longer flags lookalikes via substring matches (e.g. `refresh` containing Facebook's `fr` cookie, `notfacebook.com` containing "facebook"), and generic CDNs (CloudFront, S3, etc.) are no longer counted as trackers.
- Overview site logs now show sensitive fields that appeared after the initial page analysis.
- The README badge now links to the live Chrome Web Store listing.

## v1.4.2

**What's new**

- Restored the README screenshots in a tracked `screenshots/` folder after untracking the `docs/` directory.
- Releases now ship with curated "What's new / What was fixed" notes (changelog-driven).

**What was fixed**

- Full ToS;DR privacy-policy catalog (412 graded domains, up from 66) with point-by-point details and document links.
- "Enhanced Policy Analysis" renamed to **Live rating updates**.
- Vault auto-lock now actually re-locks the UI after the timeout.
- PII penalties resolve the correct site's reputation instead of the active tab.
- Locked-vault buffer moved to session storage, matching the privacy policy.
- Same-party tracker/cookie matching no longer treats lookalike domains (e.g. `notexample.com`) as first-party.
- Tracking score computed from the bundled tracker databases.
- Eliminated lost-update races on counter increments.
- Progressive backoff on failed master-password attempts.
- Import/restore for exported backups.

## v1.4.1

**What's new**

- Production-readiness audit remediation (security, correctness, and privacy-policy alignment).
- Bundled ToS;DR catalog and cloud-toggle rename (superseded by v1.4.2 notes).

**What was fixed**

- See the v1.4.2 "What was fixed" list above.
