 * SCORING LIBRARY - How We Calculate Website Safety Scores
 * =============================================================================
 * 
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES:
 * This file contains the math that calculates the "Website Safety Score" (WSS).
 * The WSS tells you how safe or dangerous a website is on a scale from 0 to 100.
 * 
 * SCORING PHILOSOPHY:
 * - Higher scores = BETTER (100 = completely safe, 0 = very dangerous)
 * - Each website is analyzed in 6 different ways (called "detectors")
 * - Each detector gives its own score, then we combine them with different weights
 * 
 * THE 6 DETECTORS AND THEIR WEIGHTS:
 * 1. Reputation (25%): Is this domain on a local blacklist?
 * 2. Tracking (25%): How many third-party trackers are following you?
 * 3. Cookies (15%): Are there tracking or advertising cookies?
 * 4. Fingerprinting (15%): Are scripts attempting to identify the device?
 * 5. Inputs (10%): Are there sensitive fields like password or credit card?
 * 6. Policy (10%): What does the privacy policy say (according to ToS;DR)?
 * 
 * EXAMPLE:
 * If a site has:
 * - Good reputation: 100 × 25% = 25
 * - Some trackers: 60 × 25% = 15
 * - Few cookies: 80 × 15% = 12
 * - A canvas fingerprinting attempt: 70 × 15% = 10.5
 * - Login form: 65 × 10% = 6.5
 * - No policy rating: excluded
 * Final WSS = 69 (generally safe)

/**
 * Validates and clamps a score to ensure it's a valid number between 0 and 100.
 * 
 * Sometimes calculations might produce weird values (like NaN, undefined, or -5).
 * This function catches those problems and returns a safe, valid score.
 * 
 * @param score - The score to validate (might be undefined, null, or NaN)
 * @param fallback - What to use if the score is invalid (default: 50)
 * @returns A valid score between 0 and 100
 * 
 * EXAMPLES:
 * - validateScore(85) → 85 (valid, no change)
 * - validateScore(150) → 100 (clamped to max)
 * - validateScore(-10) → 0 (clamped to min)
 * - validateScore(undefined) → 50 (uses fallback)
 * - validateScore(NaN) → 50 (uses fallback)
